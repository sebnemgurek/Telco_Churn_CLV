# Customer Lifetime Value 
It is a measurement that enables businesses to define their highest and lowest profitable customers and to direct their marketing strategies and tactics accordingly.

Customers are segmented because not all customers have the same value and because of limited business resources, they cannot all be handled with the same quality.

Customer lifetime value also gives you an idea of whether any customer will turn into a repeat customer. The higher the customer lifetime value, the higher the brand loyalty and purchasing behavior is expected. 

Purpose: to find its value in the company by comparing the behavior of all customers in our company and considering the buying habits of a single customer.
